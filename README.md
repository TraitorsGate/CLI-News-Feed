# CLI-News-Feed
Python program to scroll RSS feeds in CLI

This is a simple python3 program I wrote for a Raspberry Pi to read from RSS feeds, pull the titles, and then print any new titles on the screen.
You will need to have installed BeautifulSoup for this program to work.
I tested the program in PowerShell, and the CLI in Ubuntu Server 20.04.
At the moment, I'm using a RPi behind a TV to show news.  It isn't beautiful, but functionally simplistic.

Feel free to use this however you would like!
